# README - MOVIEW REVIEW WEB APP

By using the Review Web App, users can view a list of movies and their
reviews. Users can create their own accounts and login into their accounts.

Apart from viewing reviews posted by others, they can create their own
reviews and edit them later if needed. Users can either select movies from
the movie list or search for the movies they want. The movies show the image,
title, description, rating and reviews.
